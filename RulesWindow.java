First two cards are dealt to each of the players, then the first round of betting commences.  Next the first three community cards are dealt face-up on the board.  After the second betting round, the fourth community card is dealt face-up (this is called the turn card).  After the third betting round, the fifth and final community card is dealt (this is called the river card). A final round of betting ensues, and afterwards each player turns their hole cards face up. The highest hand that can be made with any combination of a player's hole cards and the five community cards wins the pot.");				JScrollPane scrollingResult = new JScrollPane(rulespace);				content.setLayout(new BorderLayout());				content.add (name, BorderLayout.NORTH);		content.add (scrollingResult, BorderLayout.CENTER);				setVisible (true);	}	}
